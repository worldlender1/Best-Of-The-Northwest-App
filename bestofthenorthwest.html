        <h2>The Best Places to Hike Within 60 Minutes of Seattle</h2>
        <p>The Greater Seattle Area is home to some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Below are a few of my personal favorites:</p>
        <h2> Rattlesnake Ridge </h2>
        <p> This is a fine hike on a well maintained, albeit busy trail through the forest with views of the Cedar River watershed, Mount Si, Mount Washington, Rattlesnake Lake and Chester Morse Lake.</p>

        </ul>

          <h2> Mt. Si </h2>
          <p> In the legends of the Snoqualmie people, Mount Si was the body of the moon, fallen to earth through the trickery of the fox and the blue jay. The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale.
